           <!-- What is XHTML -->
    <!-- XHTML stands for Extensible HYPERTEXT markup Language -->
    <!--XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML  -->
    <!-- XHTML  is HTML defiend as an XML application-->
    <!-- XHTML is supportedd by all major browsers -->

    <!-- Why XHTML -->

    <!-- XML is a markup language where all documents must be marked up correctly-->

    <!-- XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats such as XMl. In addition, browsers ignore erors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errosrs in the markup. so XHTML comes with a much stricter eror handling -->
